#Defense mechanism
if frequent occurrences of unknown destination address and
the number of ARP request packets is large
 if received packets (r) > sent packets (t) then
  if the number of mismatches between a destination address and a flow
   table entry is high then
   start dropping packets
 else
  if the network has recently been attacked then
   update the active flow rule

#User datagram protocol (UDP) Defense Section
Activation of the detection mechanism to check on network conditions
r = number of packets received by the port
t = number of packets sent by the port
if r > t then
 increased rules and drop packet
else
 if packet per second abnormal then
  return detection mechanism.

#Bandwidth monitoring section code
rx_bytes = 0 (received bytes)
tx_bytes = 0 (transmitted bytes)
rx_band = 0 (receiving bandwidth)
tx_band = 0 (transmitting bandwidth from a given port)
Calculate current flow rate
Update rx_bytes; tx_bytes; rx_band; tx_band
Give traffic situation for the port.

#Analysis of packet IP addresses
Get packet content
x = dst_ip
int y # number y is the number for counting
if the port is abnormal
 if x is in the TABLE
  y = y − 1
 else add x to the TABLE
   y = y + 1
 
#Release rules used to block abnormal port packets
y = packet number
P = set of all packets
if y > 500 then
 for all p in P do
  if address of p has been recorded in the flow table
  else
   drop packet
